### Hi there 👋

I'm Adithya Swaminathan, a full-time Technology Engineer at IBM with a degree in Computer Science and Math. Currently, I am trying to expand my horizons and work on some cool projects for the fun of it. I'm looking for any cool opportunities in the ML/AI subfield as well!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my internship, but I am also still keeping up with developing projects on my own time.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about LLMs (large language models), and I would love to have an opportunity to learn more!
- 💻 I have the most experience in Python and C++ as a programmer, but I have also worked on Verilog and MIPS Assembly.
- 💬 Ask me about any of the projects I have up here!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Lakers fanatic (since 2010, so you know I'm not a frontrunner), and also *coincidentally* happen to be a **huge** LeBron James fan
