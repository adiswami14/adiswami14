### Hi there 👋

I'm Adithya Swaminathan, an undergraduate at UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) working towards a degree in Computer Science and Math. Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will help me delve into the ML/AI and Cloud Computing subfields of CS. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my internship, but I am also still keeping up with developing projects on my own time.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, while also focusing on honing my skills on JS and R.
- 💻 I have the most experience in C++ and Java as a programmer, but I have also worked on Verilog and MIPS Assembly.
- 💬 Ask me about any of the projects I have up here!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Lakers fanatic (since 2010, so you know I'm not a frontrunner), and also *coincidentally* happen to be a **huge** LeBron James fan
