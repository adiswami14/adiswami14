### Hi there 👋

<!--
**adiswami14/adiswami14** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Adithya Swaminathan, an undergraduate at UIUC (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) working towards a degree in Computer Science and Math. Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will help me delve into the ML/AI and Cloud Computing subfields of CS. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on research, but I am also still keeping up with developing projects on my own time.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Mathematica, as well as discovering more of Python and JS.
- 💬 Ask me about any of the projects I have up here!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Lakers fanatic (since 2010, so you know I'm not a frontrunner), and also *coincidentally* happen to be a **huge** LeBron James fan
